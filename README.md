A daily email report that aggregates nutritional data from Myfitnesspal and adds a few metrics that Myfitnesspal chose not to add. While I find their in-app dashboards great for looking at a day to day basis, I was disappointed with what their app offered in the way of tracking nutrition over longer periods.

So I created this simple yet great email report using python and Jupyter Notebook to add week by week and 7-day rolling metrics that can help one losing weight make better inferences on their progress beyond looking at a scale.

For me, this helped me optimize my meal preps based on a weekly rather than a daily view to help me fulfill my caloric and macro nutritional needs. It also helped me figure out when I can have my "cheat meals" and not have to worry about gaining any weight.
